neutral,I think they are reluctant in getting into the electric vehicle (EV) space. I don't know I think I feel that every company whoever is basically in the market probably will have to look at this space very seriously. If you are delayed well quite possible I think the second entry would be slightly costly for such companies and that is where I think I am slightly more mindful of the strategy which Eicher Motors is playing they would like to I think get into EV space little late as it appears right now from their commentary so I think this is putting in a little bit cautious mode.

Our research suggests that 16,350 is an important support level in the short term, if the market sustains above this level, we can expect the market to remain positive and gain momentum, leading to an upside projection till 16,700-16,750 level.

neutral,Samir Arora, founder & fund manager of Helios Capital said that it’s hard to buy recent listings given the strong listing gains. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, he said, “We want to dabble at initial public offering (IPO) price and not post listing price because it’s another 20-30-40 percent higher. So with great difficulty in some cases, we may reconcile that the IPO price is quite okay. But then, if you are not getting it at IPO price and getting it 30 percent higher then what's the point.” He further added, “The same thing happened for Zomato. We would have bought at Rs 90-95 and then it opened at Rs 120. So we had actually put a normal bid in the IPO for USD 50-70 million, but what is the use? You get USD 1 million. We sold that also and moved on in life.”

We raise our FY22-24CL Ebitda 8%-13% and lift our EV-Ebitda valuation for AHL based on the stake sale traction following a recent peer transaction. This lifts our target price from Rs 2,900 to Rs 4,420; we upgrade our rating from Sell to Outperform accordingly. A big valuation surprise for AHL would be required to drive significant upside, in our view, CLSA said.
positive,It is the HDFC of the healthcare business. The kind of online sales that they have been able to notch up, the kind of value chain that they are part of is extremely promising. That platform itself is something that will scale up far more rapidly at 2-3x of the regular growth rate for the overall business. So I am quite positive. I won’t be surprised if this start becoming the go-to stock if you had to have any representation in the healthcare segment in the country.

positive,The equity market is likely to continue with its strong positive momentum as the economic activities are expected to further pick up the pace with the lockdown measures getting relaxed. The result season is now largely over with corporate earnings being in line to better than expectations. Going ahead, we expect corporate earnings to improve further as the economy opens up and improving vaccination trends. We estimate Nifty EPS for FY22E/FY23E at Rs 725/Rs 862 which implies growth of 35%/19% respectively.
positive,The market has been witnessing a rotation from mid to large caps – a phenomenon we believe could continue as well in the near term given the sharp outperformance of the broader market in the last 18 months. In terms of sectors we remain positive on IT, Metals, Cement, select BFSI, Consumer, Auto, and Healthcare space.
negative,The Nifty is going through a big expansion after breaking past the 15,500-15,900 range in which it was stuck for a month. There is big money waiting on the sidelines and hence dips and consolidations on Nifty do not last long, writes CNBC-TV18’s Anuj Singhal

negative,MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.2 percent, nudging back toward the lows for the year touched last month. Chinese blue chips were hanging onto gains of 0.3 percent, perhaps in anticipation of a more aggressive policy easing from Beijing. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.8 percent, though economic growth topped forecasts for the June quarter.
neutral,Markets are taking comfort from the upbeat global markets and supportive domestic cues amid the fear of a third COVID wave. However, we’re now seeing restricted participation and expect the same trend to continue, at least in the near future. We thus advise continuing with the “buy on dips” approach but focus largely on index majors and select midcaps for long trades. Among the sectors, participants should focus on banking (mainly private), financials, energy, FMCG and metal for fresh positions while pharma, media and realty may continue to trade lackluster.
positive,China's factory output and retail sales both rose more slowly than expected in July from a year ago, data showed on Monday, amid signs of increasing pressure on China’s economy as export growth cooled and new COVID-19 outbreaks disrupted business.

negative,Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Monday, dropping for a third session, as government-imposed restrictions on mobility to counter the spread of the Delta variant raised worries about a recovery in fuel demand. Brent crude was down 80 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $69.79 a barrel, after edging lower last week. US oil fell by 81 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $67.63 a barrel, having risen slightly last week.
positive,Japan's economy rebounded more than expected in the second quarter after slumping in the first three months of this year, data showed, a sign consumption and capital expenditure were recovering from the coronavirus pandemic's initial hit.
negative,But many analysts expect growth to remain modest in the current quarter as the state of emergency curbs reimposed to combat a spike in infections weigh on household spending.
positive,The world's third-largest economy grew an annualised 1.3 percent in April-June after a revised 3.7 percent slump in the first quarter, preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data showed on Monday, beating a median market forecast for a 0.7 percent gain.
negative,The dollar held near a one-week low versus major peers on Monday, after slumping the most in almost seven weeks on Friday as diving US consumer confidence hurt bets for an early tightening of Federal Reserve policy. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, was little changed at 92.528, maintaining a 0.50 percent tumble from the end of last week.
negative,Asian share markets made a cautious start to the week on Monday ahead of a raft of Chinese data that could confirm a slowdown in the giant economy, as much of the world races to stem the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 with vaccinations. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat in early trade, having hit its lows for the year last month. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2 percent, though economic growth pipped forecasts for the June quarter.
positive,US stock markets hit new record highs on Friday, boosted by forecast-beating corporate earnings, but the dollar and Treasury yields fell after data showed US consumer confidence plummeted in early August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.06 points, or 0.05%, to 35,515.91, the S&P 500 gained 7.26 points, or 0.16%, to 4,468.09 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.64 points, or 0.04%, to 14,822.90.
negative,Indian equity benchmark indices ended at record closing levels Friday led by strong buying in IT and metal stocks. The Sensex jumped 593.31 points, or 1.08 percent, to close at 55,437.29, while the Nifty ended 164.70 points, or 1.01 percent, higher at 16,529.10. Broader markets underperformed the benchmarks as the smallcap and midcap indices closed lower.
neutral,Among sectors, gains were seen in IT, FMCG, financial services and metal indices, while pharma, media and realty indices ended in the red.
negative,Markets traded highly volatile on account of weekly F&O expiry session and ended in the red. We remain cautious on the markets as there is no clear direction over the next move. High volatility and profit-taking in broader markets are adding to the participants’ worries. We suggest investors remain selective and prefer investing in defensive sectors such as FMCG, IT and Pharma.
negative,Though gross market volumes have been relatively weak compared to the trend in July, large-caps have seen stronger flows than mid-caps. In fact, aggregate advance-decline ratio on NSE has been adverse throughout the last week, with mid-cap & small-cap indices under-performing Nifty by 100 bps & 200 bps respectively over this period. This has also coincided with Retail net long open interest in single stock futures reducing by 30,000 lots (approx. Rs 2,400 crs worth), pointing to reducing leverage in long positioning.
positive,Nifty has also out-performed Asian and EM peers over the last week, with a strong trend in passive foreign flows, as foreign funds have aimed to re-allocate weights from China towards India. Launches of new domestic MF schemes have brought in fresh inflows of approx. Rs 8,000 crore, with a dominant focus on consumer themes. Banks remain the predominant under-performing sector while IT sector has been an out-performer.
negative,The market seems to have started tiring at the new highs of 16m700. But, there is no indication of any reversal pattern unfolding at the higher levels. Any decline from here down to the support of 16m400 (20 day EMA on a daily chart) could be a buy on dips opportunity in the near term. We expect an upside bounce from the lows in the coming sessions. The upside target for Nifty remains at 16m900 levels.
negative,The rupee/dollar spot closed 11 paise lower near 74.24 levels but very much within the two-month-old range of 74.00 and 74.80/75.00 levels. With a stronger US Dollar index being countered by falling oil prices and corporate $ inflows, USDINR may remain within the low volatile zone for some more time. Tonight, US FOMC minutes may be a market mover, which could likely push USDINR higher towards 74.40 levels, if they sound hawkish.
negative,Nifty has formed a bearish “Dark cloud cover” on daily charts. Even though it made a new high in the morning, the fact that contrary to the regional markets it failed to sustain gains and ended in the negative raises some concerns. The broader market continues to show a negative advance-decline ratio for the fourth consecutive session. Nifty may find it difficult to breach today’s high of 16,702 for the next 1-2 sessions. 
negative,The market had been rallying sharply over the past few sessions and hence investors booked some profit today, but not before key benchmark indices hit fresh record highs in early trade. After a long time on daily charts, Nifty has formed a bearish candle and intraday charts are also indicating a further weakness from current levels. In the near future, the benchmark index may consolidate between 16,420 to 16,700 levels. On the downside, 16,500-16,450 could be the key support levels. On the other hand, the 16,650-16,700 level would be the immediate hurdle for the Nifty and below the 16,450 level, the uptrend could be vulnerable.
neutral,Nifty will have immediate support at 16,500 levels followed by 16,450-16,375 levels and on the upside 16,700 will act as resistance. Nifty Bank which underperformed Nifty50 has immediate support at 35,300 & if it breaks this level then 35,000- 34,850 will be the next support level. On the upside 35,800 will be the hurdle above which 36,000-36,200 will act as a resistance level.
neutral,The market has witnessed some correction from the higher levels of 16,700. It is going to be crucial for the short-term market scenario to sustain above the 16,500 Nifty50 Index level. Early signs of reversal in the market with deviation occurring in Nifty50, Nifty mid-cap, and Nifty small-cap. Hence traders are advised to refrain from building a new buying position until we see further improvement in the market breadth.
negative,The Indian equity benchmark indices ended lower Wednesday dragged by selling in metals and private banking stocks. The Sensex fell 162.78 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 55,629.49, while the Nifty ended at 16,568.85, down 45.75 points, or 0.28 percent. Broader markets closed mixed as the midcap index gained, while the smallcap index ended in the red.
negative,Among sectors, Nifty Metal, Nifty Private Bank and Nifty Realty fell the most followed by financial services, auto and media indices, while pharma, FMCG, PSU Bank and IT indices ended in the green. Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindalco Industries, ICICI Bank, SBI Life Insurance and Tata Motors were the top Nifty50 losers, while Eicher Motors, UltraTech Cement, Bajaj Finance, Adani Ports & SEZ and Grasim Industries were the top index gainers.
positive,We are seeing a huge impetus for renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs). One of the benefits, which benefits from this decarbonisation theme is copper. Renewable energy, EVs and upgrading of power grids are the areas where copper is going to be used in a big way. The best way to play copper is to buy a company that is into copper refining and treatment. Hindustan Copper where you have almost 3.5-4 million tonnes of copper capacity today. In the next five-six years, they want to take it to 20 million tonnes. It is a great play if they get their act right if they are able to improve their efficiency and increase their recoverable copper.
positive,I think the market rally has surprised many of the investors and industry participants. But we had expected that the latest round of the rally would be led by largecap and that is happening. We do expect that there can be some marginal correction here and there but the continued momentum into the largecap space will go on. So, we may see some tactical profit booking in short term, but the view remains constructive and positive, especially on the largecap side. We have been bullish on, IT, consumer discretionary, and tactically materials as well.

negative,Every month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) releases a bulletin, which carries an assessment of the economy and market reads. This helps to understand when the Central Bank might start reducing liquidity or change its accommodative stance. The assessment of the market from the August bulletin is dovish.
negative,The RBI sounds positive on economic recovery, especially when it talks about exports, toll and tax collections. Analysing the first quarter of the 1,427 companies, which accounts for 86 percent of the market, RBI says sales are up 57 percent year-on-year, but down 9 percent. Demand is limping back towards normal, but a catch-up will take some time. This indicates that although the RBI is positive on growth, it is still dovish.
positive,Shares, oil and Asian currencies all steadied on Wednesday as investors weighed the gradual opening of economies worldwide against rising cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant. European shares edged up with the benchmark STOXX index rising 0.3% after MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.46%, snapping five successive sessions of decline but still only a little above year-to-date lows. Oil also recovered slightly after four days of straight declines as investors fret over demand for fuel as the virus continues its spread worldwide.

positive,Global cotton prices are trading at a seven-year high and the Indian cotton prices are not too far away from all-time highs that hit in the month of July. Prices saw 3 percent gains in this week itself and were up by 10 percent in the previous month. The global prices have surged past 97 cents a bushel.

neutral,Auto companies are in focus after the government notified the rates for the said RoDTEP scheme. The rates stand at 1-1.5 percent lower than the earlier MEIS export benefit of 2 percent. CNBC-TV18 spoke to Rakesh Sharma, ED, Bajaj Auto, to know what this really means for the auto sector, especially for two-wheeler makers. Sharma said, “The rates for the two-wheelers is between 1.2 to 1.4 percent depending on the engine displacement and for three-wheelers, the rate is 1.4 percent. From a two-wheeler perspective, as we understand at Bajaj Auto, this is fair compensation for the taxes, duties and levies, which we have to pay domestically.”
positive,Subex announced that it has been awarded a seven-digit, five-year contract from Dhiraagu, the leading telecom operator of Maldives, to provide its integrated Revenue Assurance and Fraud Management (iRAFM) solution.

positive,Technically bulls have some near-term advantage and closing above $1,800/oz will add incremental traction in gold prices, analysts said.
negative,The shares of Maruti Suzuki rose over half a percent in the morning session after Goldman Sachs retained a 'buy' rating on the stock despite the company cutting the production limit for August. GS has a target price of Rs 9,036 per share, over 30 percent higher than its current market price of Rs 6,890. The brokerage firm said in its morning note that chip shortage could cause a sharper near-term production impact on the company. Maruti Suzuki had said on Tuesday the semiconductor chip shortage could force it to cut vehicle production in August by 30-40 percent. This could make nearly three-fourths of the five percent annual production cut it forecasted earlier
positive,Sensex is continuing its northward journey with new highs every day for the last five trading sessions supported by inflows in large-cap stocks especially IT names. August month is all about large caps after three months of underperformance where Sensex is likely to test the 57,000 marks while 55,800-56,000 is the intermediate resistance zone. On the downside, 55,500 is immediate and strong support while 54,750 will be the next important support at any correction.

positive,The Indian benchmark had a positive start in the market following the positive global sentiments and among the Asian peers. Following the positive sentiments market has been able to touch the levels of 16,700 in the Nifty50 Index. The positive in the market sentiments remain intact as the efforts from the government to keep the economy on track has started to show results with manufacturing numbers have shown signs of recovery and the services sector is coming back on track as well. Our research suggests that 16,500 will be an important support level in the short term. Indicators suggest a volatile movement in the small range between 16,500-16,700.
neutral,Gail (India) has issued a tender seeking to buy a liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo for delivery into India and offering a cargo for loading from the United States, Reuters reported quoting industry sources.

positive,Motherson Group said that it has joined the United Nations Global Compact (UN Global Compact), a strategic initiative that supports global companies with the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices.
neutral,It is something that is coming out of underperformance. My sense is that closing above Rs 1,550 should see the stock attempt the earlier highs of Rs 1,620. So positive chart structure, wait for the stock to see if it closes Rs 1,550 today or tomorrow. 
positive,It is overbought but one stock that has given a very different breakout is Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Getting past these levels of Rs 3,400-3,430 was a major boost on the medium-term to long-term chart although it has been making higher highs on these charts for quite a few months now. This was a rising trendline resistance breakout. That should suggest that TCS over the next few months should definitely cross Rs 4,000. Extremely positive over there despite it being overbought, that is one stock I want to add – I have in the portfolio and would add on any 3-4 percent kind of a decline.
positive,The share price of Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) gained over 4 percent after the company signed a Rs 5,375- crore contract with GE Aviation. The state-run aerospace firm said it has placed an order of Rs 5,375 crore for 99 F404-GE-IN20 engines and support services with GE Aviation, US to power the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).
positive,The price of 14.2-kg LPG domestic cylinder has been hiked by Rs 25 per cylinder. A domestic LPG cylinder of 14.2-kg will now cost Rs 859 in Delhi.
positive,The share price of Bharat Dynamic surged over 4 percent after the company and MBDA signed an agreement to establish an advanced short-range air-to-air missile facility in India. Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) and MBDA signed a licencing agreement to establish a manufacturing facility for the Final Assembly, Integration and Test (FAIT) of Advanced Short Range Aijr-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) missiles in India, the company said in a regulatory filing.
neutral,Under the licensing agreement, MBDA will transfer the equipment and knowledge to BDL for establishing the facility. Work on establishing this capability in India is due to start immediately and is expected to commence operations by the year 2022-23.
positive,Sun Pharmaceutical Industries' FY21 annual report emphasises ramping up existing specialty products and investing in the novel R&D pipeline and in-licensing to complement existing therapies. Excluding subsidiary Taro’s Rs43bn provisioning impact, Sun’s OCF and FCF grew 42/61% YoY. SG&A costs declined sharply due to Covid-related travel restrictions; this may have reduced losses for the global specialty business but we expect some of those to return as operations normalise. We reiterate a BUY rating and a Rs 960 target price.
neutral,The market has been consistently surprising even the incorrigible optimists by setting new records. The Sensex has scaled the 56,000 mark this morning. It is interesting to note that the Sensex has multiplied 560 times since its inception with 1979 as the base year. By averaging around 15% CAGR during the last 42 years, Sensex has rewarded long-term investors handsomely. However, the journey of the market has been volatile with sharp ups and downs unnerving the short-term investors and traders. The future would be no different.
neutral,The present bull run primarily driven by the new retail investors is in an overbought, richly valued zone. This year metal index has been the outperformer with Nifty Metal Index leading with 76% return followed by the Nifty IT Index with 38% return. But it is important to remember that even sectors with good earnings visibility, like IT and metals, are highly valued. Therefore, even while remaining invested in this bull market, investors have to be cautious while committing fresh funds.
negative,Vedanta share price extended losses on a second day after the mining and metals major on Tuesday dealt with twin blows. First, the Madras High Court issued notice to the company on remediation of contaminated sites at the Tuticorin unit.

positive,Auto forged components manufacturer Bharat Forge is set to enter the electric vehicle (EV) space with two-wheelers and three-wheelers in FY22, moneycontrol.com reported. The launch, scheduled for the second half of the year, will further highlight how companies are rushing to tap the upcoming and burgeoning EV segment.
positive,The rupee appreciated 6 paise to 74.29 against the US dollar in early trade on Wednesday as strong buying in domestic equities and weakness in American currency overseas strengthened investor sentiment. However, high crude prices in the international market and foreign capital outflows restricted the rupee rise, forex dealers said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened strong at 74.30 against the dollar, then gained further ground to 74.29, a rise of 6 paise over its previous close.
positive,The markets are factoring in the optimism due to the higher vaccinations that will help restore economic activity post the 2nd Covid wave. The large caps are now doing well, catching up with the underperformance of the last six months while the small and mid-cap space is seeing a correction. There is a lot of liquidity that is chasing equity markets, said Arun Malhotra, Founding Partner & Portfolio Manager, CapGrow Capital Advisors LLP.
neutral,Trade is to switch from small and mid-cap space to large caps. The large caps have not participated in the last six months rally and still offer decent upside. There is froth in the small and midcap space that has to get corrected
neutral,Arvind Sanger, managing partner of Geosphere Capital Management, on Wednesday, said that IT is a safe place to hide as it provides stability in a portfolio, but don’t expect big outperformance. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, he said, “IT has become a safe place to hang out because you don't have to worry about China's slowdown, you don't have to worry about COVID concerns, none of these things seems to matter because growth is somewhat more predictable. So, yes, they are safe places to hang out and in a portfolio, they provide a bit more stability and less volatility, but if you are playing it upcycle over the next 2-3 years, I do not believe that this will be where the big outperformance will come from here.
neutral,India International Exchange will soon facilitate buying and selling of shares of foreign stocks, including major US-listed companies, through its platform. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, V Balasubramaniam, MD & CEO of the exchange said, “We are a subsidiary of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Around 3 years back, we created our subsidiary platform under INX, all the India INX global access and we got recognition from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). This was primarily to provide outbound access. So typically in India, we look at inbound access, where foreign investors come and invest in India as foreign portfolio investment (FPI).”
positive,The outperformance of large-caps, aided by the robust performance of IT majors, is likely to continue as the froth in the broader market is slowly getting removed. This is a healthy sign. An important trigger for the market today would be the good news for HDFC Bank. RBI's decision to partially remove restrictions on credit card issuances by HDFC Bank would help this bluechip regain some of its lost shine. This would be favourable to Bank Nifty too which has been underperforming this year. But it is important to understand that partly the good news is already in the price since HDFC Bank is up by 6% this month, perhaps in anticipation of the positive development. Meanwhile, retail investors continue to buy aggressively in the market unmindful of the excessive valuations, particularly in the broader market. It's time to move over to the safety of large-caps from the over-valued mid-and small-caps.
positive,Export incentive due to RoDTEP is fair compensation for two-wheelers, while there is some shortfall in compensation for 4-wheelers, said Rakesh Sharma, ED, Bajaj Auto. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Sharma said that the RoDTEP benefit will accrue to the company from January 1 and they will take a call on which quarter to book RoDTEP benefit in. He believes the PLI scheme is powerful to promote manufacturing in India, but the scheme details for autos have still not come
positive,Bajaj Auto’s exports are steady, but the ASEAN sector is still reeling under pressure from the pandemic, he said. Domestic demand in August was at levels similar to July, but the demand in July and August is usually damp for 2-wheelers. Three-wheeler traffic is increasing, so that demand is coming back, he said.
negative,On the impact of semiconductor chip shortages, he said that the company could see a 5-7 percent impact on sales
positive,We believe HDFC Bank, having added close to 3.65 mn liability accounts from Jan 2021 to June 2021, can easily capture market share in the credit card space. HDFC Bank roughly used to add 0.15-0.20 mn credit cards per month pre-Covid. Hence, since Dec’2020, the bank perhaps failed to add 1.4-1.8 mn credit cards. There is a large customer base to which they can cross sell in our view. Despite all the worries on the technology front, the bank continues to add liability accounts at a fast pace which implies that customer acquisition hasn’t been affected. ROAs remain best in class at around 1.9-2.0%. Loan growth at 14% YoY is almost ~3x of system growth which is commendable considering HDFC Bank has a 10% market share.
positive,The index is trading above the resistance level of 16,600. This should allow Nifty to achieve its next target of 16,800-16,850. Good support lies at 16,400 and hence any dip can be utilized to accumulate long positions.
neutral,The equity market is beginning to turn unfavourable and the investors need to be selective hereon, says Mahesh Nandurkar, India Strategist, Jefferies. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Nandurkar advised investors to have a bottom-up approach at current levels. He believes every successive Covid wave will have lesser economic and market impact. We may be seeing initial signs of Covid cases rising in India again, while the recovery post-second wave has been faster than last year
neutral,However, he is of the view that the return of normalised monetary policy will be the near-term risk and a strong economic recovery has to be followed by monetary policy normalization.
neutral,The metal stocks still at reasonable levels on a price-to-book basis. Even if metal prices move down, we are still looking at 15-20% ROE
